# MyReads Project

This is my Project 6 for Udacity's Front-End Web Development nanodegree.

# Running the application

First, clone the project to your local machine and navigate to the project folder.

Install the dependencies with `npm install`.

To start the development server, enter `npm start`.

# Instructions

You will see three shelves: `Currently Reading`, `Want to Read`, and `Read`.
To move a book, simply click on the arrow button, then choose the shelf you want to move the book to.

To search, click on the `+` button at the bottom right of the screen. Then, enter the title or author of the book. Select the book by clicking on the arrow button on the book, and selecting the shelf you desire.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
